# SurveyWithTkinter
Survey created using Tkinter and Python

I created a survey using Tkinter and Python for research done at Zhejiang University. I am uploading the survey for others to use in their own projects. 

Please give me a shout out if you decide to use the program in your work. I'd really appreciate it.  

## Screenshots
The questions used on the survey are in Mandarin (due to the survey being given here in China). I stopped translating the buttons in order to upload it on GitHub. Check the comments in the code to see which parts you need to change in order to use the project yourself. 

The survey consists of four different parts (each part separated by a dialog box to inform the user).

Once the user reaches the end, the answers from the questions are written to a csv file.
